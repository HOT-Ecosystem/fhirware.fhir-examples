Schemas for FHIR 4.6.0.  See: http://hl7.org/fhir/2021May/downloads.html

There are issues with schema files for 4.6.0. At least the XSD schemas are broken but the JSON ones might also have issues. The XSD files are not used but the JSON ones appear to work and they are configured so that one is able to explore 4.6.0 changes.

See [the issue](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/xsd.20not.20valid) at the FHIR chat site.
